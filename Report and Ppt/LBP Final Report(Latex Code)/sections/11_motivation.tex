The motivation behind our project is driven by the critical need for effective camouflage detection in military and security operations. Camouflage is a technique used by adversaries to conceal objects and personnel from view, making it difficult for military and security personnel to detect and respond to potential threats. Camouflaged objects can pose a significant risk to personnel and can hinder the success of military and security operations.\\
Traditional imaging techniques, such as RGB imaging, may not be sufficient to detect camouflaged objects in complex and varied environments. Camouflage techniques can be designed to blend in with the surrounding environment, making it difficult to distinguish them from the background. This can make it challenging to detect camouflaged objects using traditional imaging techniques.\\
The development of deep learning models, such as SINet, has shown great promise in detecting camouflaged objects in various environments. However, the performance of these models can be limited by the quality and complexity of the input images. Multispectral imaging, which involves capturing images at different wavelengths, can provide additional information that is not visible in the RGB image. This additional information can be used to enhance the performance of deep learning models in detecting camouflaged objects.\\
