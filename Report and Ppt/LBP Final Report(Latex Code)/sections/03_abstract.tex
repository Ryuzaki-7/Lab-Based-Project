We present our study on Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), which aims to identify objects that are visually embedded in their background. The high intrinsic similarities between the concealed objects and their background make COD far more challenging than traditional object detection/segmentation. Our work is based on Search Identification Network (SINet) which is one of the best and robust architectures used in the field of COD. We have worked on RGB as well as Multi Spectral Images which consisted of 5-channel spectrum. For RGB images our model is trained and tested on varioud famous Camouflaged object datasets like COD10K, CAMO, etc. And for training our model on multi-spectral images we created Drone dataset (using the images provided by the Drone Research Center-IITR) in which each item in is created using 5 images of different spectral ranges and orientation. For that purpose we have used Data Fusion Techniques to merge 5 images into a single image. We also provide some interesting findings, and highlight several potential applications and future directions.
