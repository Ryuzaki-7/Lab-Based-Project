Camouflaged objects pose a significant threat to military and security operations, as they can remain undetected and compromise the safety of personnel and equipment. While there have been significant advancements in the development of computer vision techniques for detecting camouflaged objects, there is still a need for more accurate and robust solutions that can operate in complex environments with varying levels of illumination and clutter. Our project aims to address this problem by exploring the use of SINet-based models for detecting camouflaged objects in RGB and multispectral images, and investigating the impact of different feature extraction techniques on model performance.
